# ReaderWishlist.app
Web application built with Django that allows readers and authors to collaborate on story ideas.
## Introduction
Reader Wishlist is a web application built with Python and Django that uses writing-to-market concepts to help authors connect deeper with the types of stories readers want to read. It is driven by reader-created content that highlights what they'd like to see published in the market.
## Current Status
Working on ironing out bugs from Phase One.
### Bugs/Errors/Exceptions
* None outstanding
#### Resolved Bugs
* When listing more than two items from a database query, the third goes outside the div—fixed on 2/5/23 by moving a DIV tag
* Permissions set are not working (logged out users can submit to the database)—fixed on 2/5/23 by removing nav item with if statement for logged out users
## February 2023 Notes
### Site Design
The basic design of the website is in place. Still needs some minor tweaking for desktop browsing, and it also needs to be optimized for mobile.
### Forms
The forms for user sign-up and database entry are operational and currently being tested. The initial testing shows that they are working, but the design and development needs some work.
### Blog
The blog is fully operational and is able to accept comments. The form for entering comments needs some tweaking to the design. H
### Stories
A basic version of the story tool is up and working. However, it does lack some functionality that will be implemented in later phases of development.
